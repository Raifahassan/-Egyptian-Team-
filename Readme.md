# Egyptian-Team! Game project (X O)

Prerequisites 
HTML
CSS 
JavaScript.

Approach
Dynamic Board Creation: We dynamically generate the 3×3 grid using JavaScript.
Game State Management: We use an array to track the board state, reducing DOM dependency for game logic.
Reusable Functions: Functions handle actions like win detection, board setup, and game reset to avoid redundancy

How It Works
Game Initialization: The game board is dynamically generated using the create Board function. Each square is clickable, and its index is stored for state management.
Player Interaction: Players take turns clicking squares to mark them as “X” or “O”. After each move, the game checks for a winner or draw using the check Win function.
Win Detection: Winning combinations are pre-defined, and the game evaluates the board state to detect a winner. 
Reset: The reset button clears the board, state, and game status, allowing a new game to start
